Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the
terms of this Licence.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty
The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or

basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without
limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of

moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the
Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial
damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
damage.

However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as
far such laws apply to the Work.

9. Related agreements
While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude a related agreement,
defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence (such as for
instance a maintenance agreement) However, if accepting obligations, You may
act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to

accepted any warranty or additional liability.

Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work
or the Distribution or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.

In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means of electronic
communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a
